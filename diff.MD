## üîç Architecture Comparison (Your Project vs Traditional Setup)

| Feature                | Your Project: Go Bridge Fusion         | Traditional Node + Python Setup     |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Design Pattern         | Multi-runtime via Go bridge           | Direct Node ‚Üî Python communication   |
| Communication          | Node ‚Üî Go ‚Üî Python                     | Node ‚Üí Python (REST or subprocess)   |
| Concurrency            | Handled by Go (goroutines)            | Limited / manual async               |
| Scalability            | High ‚Äì decoupled runtimes             | Low ‚Äì tightly coupled                |
| Function Routing       | Centralized in Go                     | Handled inside Node.js               |
| Performance            | Fast and memory-efficient             | Slower, more overhead                |
| Extensibility          | Easy to plug in more runtimes         | Hard to scale beyond two runtimes    |
| Use Case Fit           | Production-grade, cloud-native apps   | Small-scale or academic projects     |
